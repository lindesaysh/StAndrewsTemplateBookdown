# Bells and Whistles {#bellsandwhistles}

Chapter \@ref(intro) briefly introduces the basic features of R Markdown and bookdown. For full details please refer to:

* [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
* [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

In this Chapter we are going to introduce *extra* features/environments, some of which will only work when using the St Andrews template. Big thanks to [TJ McKinley](https://github.com/tjmckinley/RtutorialSkeleton) for sharing with us the code for the task and solution features.  

## Task and solution block

The `task` block can be used to set exercises for the students. The `solution` block reveals the answer to the student (if enabled; more on that later). For the gitbook/HTML version 
there is a toggle button `Show Solution` that reveals the answer. In the PDF version, there is a hyperlink to take the reader to the solutions, which are in the appendix. There is also a link to get back to the place in the text from the appendix. 

The `task` block is used as follows. For example: 

````
```{task}`r ''`
Here is a task written in **markdown**.
```
````

which renders as:

```{task}
Here is a task written in **markdown**.
```

You can include chunks within the `task` chunk, but you need to use double backticks *within* the chunk, and leave carriage returns around the internal chunk. For example: 

````

```{task}`r ''`

``{r}
x <- 2 + 2
x
``

```

````

which renders as:

```{task}

``{r}
x <- 2 + 2
x
``

```

Be careful to have suitable carriage returns around e.g. `enumerate` or `itemize` environments inside the chunk also. For example:

````

```{task}`r ''`
Here is a list:
1. item 1
2. item 2
```

```` 

will not render nicely. But

````

```{task}`r ''`
Here is a list:

1. item 1
2. item 2

```

```` 

will:

```{task}
Here is a list:

1. item 1
2. item 2

```

The `solution` chunk works in the same way, and the numbers will follow the previous `task` chunk (so you can set tasks without solutions). For example:

````

```{task}`r ''`
Add 2 and 2 together
```

```{solution}`r ''`

``{r}
2 + 2
``

```

````

gives:

```{task}
Add 2 and 2 together
```

```{solution}

``{r}
2 + 2
``

```


## Different task and solution titles

`task` and `solution` boxes can be given different names using the `title` option (these can be set globally if preferred). For example:

````

```{task, title = "Question"}`r ''`
Produce a scatterplot of `mpg` against `hp`. What does the relationship look like?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer"}`r ''`

``{r}
plot(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars, 
  pch=19, col='darkgrey')
``

```

````

renders as:

```{task, title = "Question"}
Produce a scatterplot of `mpg` against `hp`. What does the relationship look like?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer"}

``{r}
plot(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars, 
  pch=19, col='darkgrey')
``

```

## Two-tabbed solution

You can have a task with **two** different solutions side-by-side, using the `multCode = T` option to the solution box. For example, you may want to show a solution using both base `R` and `tidyverse`. Here the two tabs are separated by four consecutive hashes: `####`, and the `titles` option gives the tab titles (these can be set globally if preferred). For example:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

````

```{task}`r ''`
Produce a scatterplot of `mpg` against `hp`. What does the relationship look like?
```

```{solution, multCode=T, titles = c("Base R", "tidyverse")}`r ''`

``{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width = "60%"}
plot(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars,
     pch=19, col='darkgrey')
``

The plot suggests that a linear relationship might exist between the two variables. 
So we can proceed by fitting a linear model in R.

####

``{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
``

The plot suggests that a linear relationship might exist between the two variables. 
So we can proceed by fitting a linear model in R.
    
```
````

will render as:

```{task}
Produce a scatterplot of `mpg` against `hp`. What does the relationship look like?
```

```{solution, multCode=T, titles = c("Base R", "tidyverse")}

``{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width = "60%"}
plot(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars,
     pch=19, col='darkgrey')
``

The plot suggests that a linear relationship might exist between the two variables. 
So we can proceed by fitting a linear model in R.

####

``{r, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot(mtcars) +
    geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = hp))
``

The plot suggests that a linear relationship might exist between the two variables. 
So we can proceed by fitting a linear model in R.

```

## Multi-tabbed options

You can also have just the multicode part (not embedded within the solution panel.). These appear side-by-side in the PDF document. Note that currently you can only have **two** tabs. For example:

````

```{multCode, titles=c('Part A', 'Part B')}`r ''`

Two options: 

* Option 1 - This is some text for part A

####

Two options:
    
* Option 2 - This is some text for part B

```

````

will typeset to:

```{multCode, titles=c('Part A', 'Part B')}

Two options: 

* Option 1 - This is some text for part A

####

Two options:
    
* Option 2 - This is some text for part B

```


## Task with held solutions

In the solution chunk header, if `renderSol=FALSE` then the solutions are not rendered as part of the book. For example:

````

```{task, title='Task (solution hidden)'}`r ''`
Produce a scatterplot of `mpg` against `hp`. What does the relationship look like?
```

```{solution, renderSol=FALSE}`r ''`

``{r}
plot(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars, 
  pch=19, col='darkgrey')
``

This is my solution which you will only see if `renderSol` is set to `TRUE`.

```

````

will render as:

```{task, title='Task (solution hidden)'}
Produce a scatterplot of `mpg` against `hp`. What does the relationship look like?
```

```{solution, renderSol=FALSE}

``{r}
plot(hp ~ mpg, data = mtcars, 
  pch=19, col='darkgrey')
``

This is my solution which you will only see if `renderSol` is set to `TRUE`.

```

By default, in `_setup.Rmd`, `renderSol` is set to `TRUE`. If one of your chapters is a tutorial/practical, and you want to release the answers later on in the course, 
it can become tedious having to set `renderSol` to `FALSE` for every question. 
Instead, you can override this default at the beginning of each chapter, so you can turn on/off the solutions, as follows:

````

``{r, include=F}
opts_chunk$set(renderSol=FALSE)
``

````

**Note** that the chunk above changes everything after the chunk, so later chapters will retain this change unless you reset it. 


## Adding Boxes

Sometimes you may wish to add a box section to your notes. There are currently three different coloured boxes defined; green and blue with white backgrounds and blue with pale blue background. For example, 

````
:::: {.greenbox data-latex=""}
This is an example of a green box.
::::

:::: {.bluebox data-latex=""}
This is an example of a blue box.
::::

:::: {.palebluebox data-latex=""}
This is an example of a blue box with pale blue background.
::::
````

will render as:

:::: {.greenbox data-latex=""}
This is an example of a green box.
::::
  

:::: {.bluebox data-latex=""}
This is an example of a blue box.
::::
  

:::: {.palebluebox data-latex=""}
This is an example of a blue box with pale blue background.
::::
  

You can also give your box a title. You can use `:::` to denote a separate section inside the box:

````
:::: {.palebluebox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**This is my title**
:::

This is the contents of my box.

::::

````
renders as

:::: {.palebluebox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**This is my title**
:::

This is the contents of my box.

::::


You can add equations, figures, r-code etc to your boxes. For example: 

````
:::: {.greenbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Things you can include**
:::

Equations: 
$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$

R-code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
1+1
```

Figures:
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=1,results='asis', eval=FALSE, fig.alt="University of St Andrews Logo"}
knitr::include_graphics('standard-vertical-black.png')
```

Formatting:

+ **bold**
+ *italic*
    a) sub bullets

::::
````

will render as:

:::: {.greenbox data-latex=""}
::: {.center data-latex=""}
**Things you can include**
:::

Equations: 

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X$$
R-code:

```{r}
1+1
```

Figures:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='10%'}
knitr::include_graphics('standard-vertical-black.png')
```

Formatting:

+ **bold**
+ *italic*
    a) sub bullets

::::

The colour scheme for the boxes is defined in the following files:

+ `style.css`.  For html output, see the section "Create colour scheme for boxes" 
+ `preamble.tex`. For pdf output, see the section "LaTeX to create coloured boxes"

For more information on these boxes and other custom blocks have a look at  [this section ](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html) of the R-Markdown Cookbook. 


## Shiny apps and HTML widgets

You can add [Shiny apps](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/web-pages-and-shiny-apps.html) and [HTML widgets](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html-widgets.html) to your book.

For example, using the `knitr::include_app(...)` function we can embed a Shiny app that is hosted somewhere else. 
Note that this app renders as an interactive panel in the web book and a static screenshot in the PDF.  For the PDF image to work properly, make sure you include `dev='png'` in the chunk header. You can then click on either the image or the link in the caption to live view the app. 

````
``{r myshiny, echo=FALSE, screenshot.opts=list(delay=3), dev='png',fig.cap='(ref:myshiny)'}
knitr::include_app("https://lindesaysh.shinyapps.io/faithfulshiny/", height='600px')
``
````
renders as

(ref:myshiny) An example of a shiny app. You can see a live version [here](https://lindesaysh.shinyapps.io/faithfulshiny/)

```{r myshiny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:myshiny)', screenshot.opts=list(delay=3), dev='png', cache=TRUE}
knitr::include_app("https://lindesaysh.shinyapps.io/faithfulshiny/", height='600px')
```

## TikZ

It's possible to build TikZ from bookdown, but getting it to work is non-trivial: you need to install (at least) the following packages via the R console:

```
install.packages("magick")
install.packages("pdftools")
```

both of which may require external dependencies to be installed; this seems to vary a lot between systems and if you need help with a particular system, please get in touch (fls3@).

Commutative diagrams work:
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="30%", engine='tikz', fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png', fig.align='center', fig.alt='A commutative diagram for the first isomorphism theorem', fig.cap="The First Isomorphism Theorem"}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows, patterns, cd}
\begin{tikzcd}
G \arrow[r, "\phi"] \arrow[d, "\pi"']                  & \operatorname{im}\phi \\
G/\ker{\phi} \arrow[ru, "\text{bijection}"', dotted] &  
\end{tikzcd}
```

And so does `tikzpicture` with nodes, arrows, and so on.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", engine='tikz', fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'png', fig.align='center', fig.alt='Two partitions of [-n .. -1] union [1 ..n], represented as digraphs, with the negative points of the first and positive points of the second overlayed onto each other'}
\usetikzlibrary{arrows, patterns, cd}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\tikzset{vertex/.style = {shape=circle,fill,inner sep=1.5pt}}
\tikzset{edge/.style = {-,> = latex'}}
\tikzset{dashedge/.style = {dashed,> = latex'}}
% vertices
\node[vertex, label={\scriptsize$1^+$}] (1) at (1,0) {};
\node[vertex, label={\scriptsize$2^+$}] (2) at (2,0) {};
\node[vertex, label={\scriptsize$3^+$}] (3) at (3,0) {};
\node[vertex, label={\scriptsize$4^+$}] (4) at (4,0) {};
\node[vertex, label={\scriptsize$5^+$}] (5) at (5,0) {};
\node[vertex, label={\scriptsize$6^+$}] (6) at (6,0) {};
\node[vertex] (1m) at (1,-1) {};
\node[vertex] (2m) at (2,-1) {};
\node[vertex] (3m) at (3,-1) {};
\node[vertex] (4m) at (4,-1) {};
\node[vertex] (5m) at (5,-1) {};
\node[vertex] (6m) at (6,-1) {};
\node[vertex, label=below:{\scriptsize$1^-$}] (1e) at  (1,-2) {};
\node[vertex, label=below:{\scriptsize$2^-$}] (2e) at  (2,-2) {};
\node[vertex, label=below:{\scriptsize$3^-$}] (3e) at  (3,-2) {};
\node[vertex, label=below:{\scriptsize$4^-$}] (4e) at  (4,-2) {};
\node[vertex, label=below:{\scriptsize$5^-$}] (5e) at  (5,-2) {};
\node[vertex, label=below:{\scriptsize$6^-$}] (6e) at  (6,-2) {};

\draw[edge] (1) to [bend right] (2);
\draw[edge] (1) to (1m);
\draw[edge] (3) to [bend right] (4);
\draw[edge] (4) to (5m);
\draw[edge] (4) to [bend right] (5);
\draw[edge] (1m) to [bend left] (2m);
\draw[edge] (2m) to [bend left] (3m);
\draw[edge] (4m) to [bend left] (6m);

\draw[dashedge] (1m) to (1e);
\draw[dashedge] (3m) to [bend right] (4m);
\draw[dashedge] (5m) to [bend right] (6m);
\draw[dashedge] (1e) to [bend left] (2e);
\draw[dashedge] (3e) to [bend left] (4e);
\draw[dashedge] (4e) to [bend left] (5e);

\node (G) at (-0.25, -0.5) {$\alpha$};
\node (G2) at (-0.25, -1.5) {$\beta$};
\end{tikzpicture}
```

Since these TikZ diagrams are converted to images, you must ensure that alt-text is provided for them. You should also ensure that the text surrounding the image adequately explains what the image conveys.


It doesn't seem to be possible to get `pgfplots` to work, so you may need to produce each plot manually and then include them as a figure like above. You may also wish to consider producing your plots in `R` using (e.g.) the library `ggplot2`.
